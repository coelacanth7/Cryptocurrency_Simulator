Buy low, sell high.

### Gregory Alford

This is a dinky app I built to learn about how to manage a big applications state with redux. The app allows you to view real time cryptocurrency market prices with data gathered from an api. Then, trade that cryptocurrency on a $US Dollar. You can view how bad you are doing with a portfolio that keeps track.

The application maintains no user state, so all progress will be lost if the page refreshes.
